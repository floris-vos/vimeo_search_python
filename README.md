# vimeo_search_python
searching videos by search terms on Vimeo
This is a simple piece of code, using the Requests library to get the page with search results on Vimeo.
It looks for the relevant information just by searching a string-object with the search page.
It loads the relavant info as a json object. 
Then from this json object, relevant data is taken.
